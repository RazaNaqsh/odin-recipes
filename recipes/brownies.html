    <h2>Gemma's Best Ever Brownie Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate 
        baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or 
        cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a 
        glossy "skin" on their upper crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>High-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted so you don't have any lumps in your batter.</li>
        <li>Both white sugar and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Flavorless oil, which makes them moist and fudgy.</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, but you can substitute gluten-free all-purpose flour or almond flour 1:1.</li>
        <li>And more than a cup of rich bittersweet chocolate chunks (ideally chocolate with 72% cocoa solids or more for a nice balance of bitter and sweet).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat the oven! Set aside a parchment paper-lined baking tray.</li>
        <li>Mixing time: In a large bowl, combine melted butter, oil, and both sugars before whisking in eggs, vanilla, and salt.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Fold the dry ingredients (including half of the chocolate chunks) into the wet ingredients.</li>
        <li>Batter up. Pour the batter into the tray and top with remaining chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li>It's time to throw your batter into the oven. Bake for roughly 35-40 minutes, until the center of the brownie no longer jiggles.</li>
        <li>Remove the batter from the oven. After they're removed from the oven, make sure the brownies are at room temperature before taking that sweet, chocolaty first bite.</li>
    </ol>
